                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am an IT student currently pursuing my education at Nova Scotia Community College. My journey in the world of technology began back in 2000 when I worked in the field of Electrical Engineering in China. However, I decided to change my career path and made the move to Canada.
                    During my early career, I had the opportunity to work with C programming, which has proven to be a valuable experience and a strong foundation for my current studies. Over the years, I have honed my skills in several programming languages, including Python, C, and Java, and have developed a strong proficiency in SQL. Additionally, I am well-versed in Docker for containerization, Git, GitHub for version control, and I am comfortable working in both RedHat and Ubuntu environments.
                    As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills at Nova Scotia Community College, I am actively seeking internship opportunities in the IT field. I am eager to apply my expertise in programming languages and my proficiency in SQL, in a practical, real-world setting. My experience with Docker, Git, GitHub, and working in both RedHat and Ubuntu environments has equipped me with a strong foundation for contributing effectively in a professional tech environment. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my technical abilities, problem-solving skills, and a keen interest in technological innovations to an organization where I can further develop professionally and contribute to meaningful projects.
                </p>
                    <p>I currently reside in Lower Sackville with my family, which includes my wife, two wonderful boys, and our loyal Rottweiler companion. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities such as mountain biking and hiking. Technology and the great outdoors are my passions, and I am excited to continue my journey in the IT field.
