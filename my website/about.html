                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am an IT student currently pursuing my education at Nova Scotia Community College. My journey into the world of technology commenced in 2000 when I worked in the field of Electrical Engineering in China. However, I made the pivotal decision to change my career path and relocate to Canada. During my early career, I had the opportunity to work extensively with C programming, which has proven to be a valuable experience and a robust foundation for my current studies.</p>
                <p>
                    
    I'm proficient in programming languages like Python and C. I've also been learning C++ and making progress with Java, although I'm not as skilled in it as some other languages. However, I'm determined to improve my Java skills by the end of this semester. Additionally, I have a solid foundation in SQL.</p>
                <p>In terms of tools and technologies, I'm well-versed in Docker for containerization and I'm comfortable with Git and GitHub for version control. I can work seamlessly in both RedHat and Ubuntu environments.</p>
                <p>I currently reside in Lower Sackville with my family, which includes my wife, two wonderful boys, and our loyal Rottweiler companion. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities such as mountain biking and hiking. Technology and the great outdoors are my passions, and I am excited to continue my journey in the IT field.</p>
                <p>As I continue to expand my knowledge and skills at Nova Scotia Community College, I am actively seeking internship opportunities in the IT field. My eagerness to apply my expertise in programming languages, along with my proficiency in SQL, in a practical, real-world setting drives my pursuit of internships.</p>
                <p>My experience with Docker, Git, GitHub, and working in both RedHat and Ubuntu environments has equipped me with a robust foundation for contributing effectively in a professional tech environment. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing my technical abilities, problem-solving skills, and a keen interest in technological innovations to an organization where I can further develop professionally and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
